Description:
We developed a in-memory filesystem for Xinu using the modified data structure provided by Professor Martin Swany. 
The header file "fs.h" and the shell command file "xsh_fstest.c" were provided by the Instructor. We created the system file "fs.c" which implements the basic filesystem functionalities. The functions include 
- fs_open
- fs_close
- fs_create
- fs_seek
- fs_read
- fs_write
We have included checks for error handling and file validations. Basically all these modified functions perform the same task as standard xinu functions but they work on a different data structure. 

Learning:
This assignment helped us to understand how the filesystem functionalities work in a Xinu Operating System. Looking at the actual system implementations, we created our own implementations of the basic filesystem functions which performs the same tasks.
